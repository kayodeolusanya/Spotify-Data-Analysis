# 🎧 **Spotify Listening Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)**

### *Enterprise-Grade Behavioral Insights Powered by Advanced BI & DAX*


## ⭐ **Executive Summary**

The **Spotify Listening Analytics Dashboard** is a professionally designed Power BI solution that transforms raw streaming data into **strategic insights about user behavior, engagement patterns, and content performance**.

This project demonstrates:

✔ Executive-level KPI design
✔ Strong DAX modeling and time intelligence
✔ Interactive, insight-driven reporting
✔ Real-world analytics storytelling
✔ Consumer-behavior insights similar to enterprise digital analytics

Built with a focus on clarity, performance, and executive usability, the dashboard mirrors the same analytical frameworks used by leading organizations to understand user engagement and optimize digital experiences.


## 🎯 **Project Objectives**

This analytics solution was developed to:

* Identify **behavioral trends** across albums, artists, and tracks
* Measure **year-over-year (YoY)** listening performance
* Understand engagement patterns by **time of day** and **day of week**
* Compare platform usage and playback behaviors
* Present **decision-ready KPIs** supported by robust DAX logic

The dashboard is designed with stakeholders in mind — from data analysts to executives — offering a clear view of how listening preferences evolve over time.


## 📊 **Dashboard Architecture & Key Features**

### 🔹 **1. Executive Overview Dashboard**

High-level KPIs summarizing listening behavior:

* **Total Albums Played**
* **Total Artists Played**
* **Total Tracks Played**
* Interactive **YoY performance indicators** with dynamic variance %

These metrics deliver an immediate snapshot of engagement performance similar to digital product analytics dashboards used in enterprise contexts.


### 🔹 **2. Trend & Time Intelligence Analysis**

A set of time-based visuals built using DAX time intelligence:

* Multi-year listening trends
* Growth peaks and declining periods
* Seasonality patterns
* Slicer-aware behavior enabling granular comparisons

These visuals enable leaders to understand *how engagement develops over time*.


### 🔹 **3. YoY (Latest Year vs Previous Year) Performance**

This section highlights:

* KPI-level YoY comparisons
* Percentage change logic
* Missing-period handling for clean, executive-style outputs

The visual storytelling resembles commercial BI used for revenue, usage, or customer engagement tracking.


### 🔹 **4. Platform & Playback Behavior Analysis**

Interactive filters allow segmentation by:

* Device/platform (Android, iOS, Mac, Web Player, Windows, Cast)
* Shuffle usage
* Skip behavior

This offers a product-analytics perspective comparable to platform usage dashboards used by consumer tech companies.


### 🔹 **5. Weekday vs Weekend Behavior Patterns**

Donut and segmented visuals illustrate:

* How listening shifts between workdays and weekends
* Engagement differences in albums, artists, and track frequency

This insight is valuable for content planning and understanding user mood cycles.



### 🔹 **6. Top Content Performance (Top 5 Analytics)**

Ranked insights include:

* **Top 5 Albums**
* **Top 5 Artists**
* **Top 5 Tracks**

These visuals employ ranking DAX, mirroring executive dashboards used for product, content, and marketing optimization.

### 🔹 **7. Listening Time Heatmap**

A behavioral heatmap revealing:

* Peak listening hours
* Underutilized time windows
* Daily content patterns

This visualization reflects advanced usage intelligence, critical for user-segmentation and pattern recognition.


### 🔹 **8. Engagement Scatter Analysis**

The scatter plot segments listening behavior into:

* High-engagement tracks
* Casual or low-duration plays
* Outliers and high-impact content

This supports refined analysis similar to churn prediction or engagement clustering models.

## 🧠 **DAX Modeling & Analytical Techniques**

The project leverages enterprise-level DAX patterns, including:

* **Time intelligence** (`DATEADD`, YoY logic)
* **Context transition & filtering** (`ALLSELECTED`, CALCULATE)
* Slicer-aware dynamic metrics
* KPI text measures for executive communication
* BLANK-handling for clean formatting
* Ranking functions for Top-N insights
* Conditional formatting to amplify key trends

These techniques ensure analytical accuracy, robustness, and scalability.
